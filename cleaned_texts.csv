"I am a recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan's bachelors of science program, majoring in biochemistry and biotechnology. From a young age I have always been fascinated with the natural world. Why does life exist? What processes govern the formation and behavior of individual organisms and how can those processes be exploited or modified in a beneficial manner? To this end, I have completed a fair number of biomedical science courses at my university and am seeking an opportunity to apply my knowledge of the various aspects of metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, and protein structure/function to foster a greater understanding of the world we live in, as well as make it better where I can.

"Soy licenciada y profesora en el área de la Filosofía, formada en la Argentina, dedicada a la investigación y a la educación, tanto a nivel secundario como universitario. Asimismo soy Licenciada en Psicología por la UCACIS y terapeuta en consultorio privado. A nivel pedagógico, la experiencia como profesora tutora y mis estudios en psicología me han brindado importantes habilidades para el acompañamiento, seguimiento y desarrollo de los alumnos. En el aula, estos conocimientos me han permitido desarrollar una amplia y ecléctica metodología de enseñanza, incorporando ideas y propuestas de distintos ámbitos, que favorece la concentración y el aprendizaje de nuestros alumnos, acostumbrados a múltiples y constantes estímulos por los medios de comunicación que los rodean. En investigación, he participado de variados congresos y coloquios de la mano de Alalite, y he colaborado con la edición y producción de libros. Estas actividades han enriquecido enormemente mi criterio metodológico al momento de transmitir mis conocimientos.

"Hi, I’m Sujata, a Design thinking & Business Storytelling coach with a decade of diversified corporate experience in various areas right from being a completely technical person to becoming a storyteller, with everything else in between. Ever since my childhood, I began my journey of leadership coach. Back then, I applied some amazing leadership skills to empower myself to become my best version and it didn’t stop there rather I helped my friends also, as I bring with me these Value to the group: • Creative problem solver • Great encourager and motivator • Convincing spokesperson • Negotiates conflicts by taking positive action Many of you may wonder why I worked on numerous domains - project management (PMO), .NET developer, Business process management specialist, Industry specialist and many other internal roles, all I have to say is – I didn’t wait for right opportunity I tried to build it and that helped me to embrace the discomfort and in this journey I learnt something which comes naturally to me is storytelling. What keeps me going in my journey is my attitude towards change which enabled me to embrace the discomfort, learn and grow. Enthusiastic, Influential, Expressive, Accepting and Sociable are my strengths and work style which also allows me to develop Empathy for my clients. My purpose of life is 3E’s – Explore, Experiment and Experience As you can see my journey has never been the same being from a PMO associate to a storytelling coach, I never stop exploring the opportunities around me which leads to lot of experiment adding up to my experience ( and finally I discovered my love for stories). Now with new normal I have step into personal branding, content creation, the space of podcasts, video making and social media marketing. I have delivered multiple workshops and talks in colleges as well as online events.

"WAY TO BREAK INTO A CAREER IN HUMAN RESOURCEI think that the overall idea is to have the opportunity to create an environment with the most continuous learning and training available, since much of HR is based on changing laws and regulations affecting the workplace. Getting into the habit of being educated is part of being an HR person these days since you have to keep in step with the regulations that affect the employment arena. I know many “degreed” HR people who don’t have a clue about HR, and many ‘on-the-job’ trained HR people that stay abreast of the laws and regulations of the EEOC/ADA and Dept of Labor items that affect the workplace overall.To conclude, HRFraternity acts as a one-step resource centre for all HRD related support systems. At the back end, our team of seasoned professionals, and with sufficiently built in redundancy of skills, ensures you complete Business Process Continuity.Once you join with HRFraternity, we take care of your placement activities.

Your highly intuitive way of guiding the coaching sessions allowed me to express my idea, my dream or my need, clarify it, formulate a plan and set it into motion to make it a reality. For me, our coaching relationship was synonymous with being in action, always moving forward, and I absolutely LOVED it! I was dedicated and ready to put in the work but you kept me focused and on track! I thoroughly enjoyed my coaching experience with you. It always felt like you were as dedicated to my success as I was, and at times you probably believed in me more than I believed in myself!

"A graduate with technical bachelor degree (HBO) of the Cracow University of Technology on the specialization of - systems and Transport Equipment. My career started as a technologist, designing parts in autocad for a suspended locomotive, intended for work in the underground mines. Then I improved my skills in 3d programs as a process engineer, in a company producing hoses for air conditioning in cars. January of 2018 - moving to the Netherlands, a new chapter in life - new challenges !!! I gained a great experience at Tesla Factory at Tilburg, amazing atmosphere - here I really learned what teamwork is. I also had the pleasure of participating in a two-week delegation in Norway. My next step was job at Tobroco Giant - I was absorbing knowledge of mechanics, hydraulics and electrics systems. Currently I am working as a Technician with DUV NXT systems at ASML !

"The arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday, will be sufficient for tomorrow... and that's why I strongly believe that it is time to overtake the prejudice that “only manager coming from the same business” are required for any job position. If somebody understands that different work experiences in different businesses means open mind, make the difference and easier in generating durable competitive advantages… than this is the investor-president-boss I’m looking for! I'm an Engineer and an Economist, I did study (and teach) Climate Change and I spent 10 years managing museums and exhibitions: I'm therefore fully convinced that Digital Humanities (new technologies applied to heritage) and ciurcular economy are the key drivers of next years business/life. I love books and two of my favourite authors: Milan Kundera (""Business has only two functions - marketing and innovation"") and M.rs J. K. Rowling (""Imagination is not only the capacity to envision. It is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared""). Innovation is my DNA but people keep confuse Innovation with Efficiency! Innovation is a mental attitude and has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you invest. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending 200 times more on R&D... and IBM later on simply disappeared... What can I do best? - I Play the role of a strategy coach to all departments, providing much needed support in the formulation of individual department strategies - I Support the Group towards the strategic objectives and ensure group complied with best practices - I Formulate strategy by collaborating with all stakeholders, and leading cross-functional teams in the development of group-wide operational strategies. - I prefer to maintain ownership of strategic plans and ensure compliance with these strategies. - I review, manage, and analyze existing business strategies in order to ensure alignment with the overall strategy. - I continuosly assist departmental managers in driving and optimizing improvement of key value levers that will result in a sustainable competitive advantage. - I analyze long-term market trends for the purpose of providing recommendations to Board in regard to business development opportunities, inclusive of M&A I'm enjoying to work both for private and public sectors; I love real challenges. Doing something good we love, but doing something outstanding and good for all... that's great: I love succes, but only when my group success becomes comopany, community, people, cityzens success...

"I seek an opportunity of doing focused research and development work that enhances my skills and also provides me necessary exposure for improving my analytic and technical skills. I am a self proclaimed Apple fan and have dabbled my hands in iOS and Mac app development during my initial years. Java is my heartbeat and I swear by it. Right from my school life in Kolkata, I have been actively working on various Java technologies and at the end of first year, I also did a training under IBM on various Java technologies and cloud computing. By second year, the hacking bug bit me mainly to access Wifi of restricted places with poor security. I did a course under ISOEH (Indian School of Ethical Hacking) under Ethical Hacking to further enhance my knowledge. In third year, I got an Internship in Amazon India and was put in the Supply Chain Optimisation Technologies (SCOT) team. My main job was to make a software to calculate the amount of influx of goods (using Machine Learning Techniques) and how much they needed to keep in their warehouses along with a robust notification service for the same. All the work basically involved Java. I also got exposed to Spring framework and due to rigorous testing procedures, I got familiar with almost all testing frameworks from Mockito, to PowerMock and EasyMock which is essential for robust software.

"I would like to apply my proven success in sales and customer service to assist an organization in maximizing its sales growth and market share. I am successful at developing and supporting teams that succeed, based in a large part on my previous success as an individual direct sales representative. Through experience, I know the pathway from the initial customer contact, to a closed sale, and how to lead the customer along that path. Previous to Charter Spectrum, I worked briefly in the insurance industry, where our goal was – in addition to new business development, client retention and expansion. My value to an organization, based on my experience, will be my ability to identify and develop leads, and utilize value-marketing to engage the customer and ultimately close sales. If you are looking for a sales team member with a track record of bringing value to his organization, I encourage a personal interview.

"Söker i min karriär, jobb inom försäljning med fokus på företagsinriktad försäljning men även mot direktmarknaden. Det innebär förhandlingar på alla nivåer på företagen, allt från mannen på golvet till VD, då självklart genom hela säljprocessen. Ser även mycket positivt på möjligheten av att vara delaktig i uppbyggnaden och rutiner för arbetsgivaren jag arbetar för. Valet av fokus har varit ett lätt och självklart val då jag uppskattar att skapa och utveckla affärsrelationer samt identifiera marknaden och affärsmöjligheter. Detta medför att mitt närmaste mål inom karriären är att jobba inom försäljning där jag kan utnyttja mina förhandlingstekniker samt erfarenheter. Är självgående och är van att hantera eget ansvar av olika slag, och har gjort det framgångsrikt genom karriären.

"The employee that a lot of jobs look for but very few can look past my age as many of my other managers and associates have described me as a revolutionary of the 80s with the skills and determination of the 50s. I give my all regardless of the task. Failing is the best way to learn but also to grow. I'm always growing and look forward to working each day and hoping to join your team soon and show what I can bring to the company. With each new advancement in my career im always open to learning a new trade and experiences from those around me and providing my own input for the advancement of the team or the company as a whole.

"Most recently I worked as a research associate within the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, MA. I am investigating molecular, cellular, and genetic changes that occur in schizophrenia. I received my master's degree at the University of New Hampshire in neuroscience where I became proficient at basic molecular biology techniques as well as the organization, perseverance, and attention to detail necessary to complete scientific experiments. I find every aspect of science exciting, whether it be sorting through the literature and brainstorming ideas, forming and refining experimental protocols, analyzing data, or interpreting and presenting results. In this regard, I value the team effort that is necessary for scientific advancement, but also feel very comfortable in an independent role. As a graduate student in neuroscience, I conducted independent research, managed a colony of transgenic mice, trained and supervised undergraduate students in the lab, and worked as a teaching assistant for both neuroscience and virology lab courses. My master's thesis research was focused on characterizing a novel neuronal population within the thalamic reticular nucleus of the rodent brain. These neurons express a neuropeptide that commonly colocalizes with endocannabinoid receptors. My role in this research was everything from the breeding of the transgenic mice that express a fluorescent protein in this specific cell population, cardiac perfusion and brain removal, brain slicing and immunohistochemistry, to analysis using confocal microscopy and ImageJ. This research provided an example of the importance of foundational, basic research that can then be applied to the treatment of diseases and disorders. In this case, all psychiatric illnesses are correlated with dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus.

"Originally starting out in the I.T. field, I discovered that the formal studies required to pursue a college education in I.T didn't appeal to me, so I change to Humanities. Through various courses and the socializing that it entailed I developed a particularly good skill in people-to-people interaction. Utilizing this skill, I found my way into the customer/clientele service industry; restaurants, tour guiding, student advisor, various computer and network-based work, mechanic, electrician, legislative aide, landscaping, and English instructing. By using my skills in handling people/customers/clients I was able to learn a wide array of abilities from these past job experiences. From living and teaching English in Japan to jumping into the electrical trade, I found an avenue to combine both my love for IT, investigation, and critical thinking skills I learned through my electrical apprenticeship. In 2020 I founded and began building CIRI Hawaii LLC, CIRI standing for Commerical Infrared Inspections. We provide electrical, mechanical, roof, building envelope, and energy audit infrared surveys for commercial facilities small and large. Not only is it our mission to serve all of Hawaii's facilities, but also to facilitate relationships with all those we come into contact with. Business is about relationships and being in Hawaii makes that statement more so. We are a Hawaii-born, raised, founded, and operated business and bring that aloha every day.

"Graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology’s BFA Photojournalism program in May 2019. I am interested in telling the stories of family structure and relationships. I find each family unique in their own way, and yet, they are all going through the same everyday hardships. A majority of my story work has been by reference from past story participants creating a unique relationship between all of their stories. I thrive working with people doing extraordinary things on an everyday basis, and I am always interested in exploring new places. I am interested in still photography, videography, picture editing, and social media.

Na maanden van voorbereiding werd in 2010 de eerste vestiging van Brownies&downieS in Veghel geopend. De combinatie van kwalitatief goede gerechten in combinatie met de unieke service van de bijzondere medewerkers zorgde voor een nieuw uniek horeca concept. Dit concept bleek dan ook direct een doorslaand succes ondanks de zware tijden in de horeca. In de loop van 2011 ontstond daarom het idee om een tweede vestiging in de directe omgeving te openen. Dit idee werd verder uitgewerkt en zo werd in 2012 de tweede vestiging in Sint-Oedenrode geopend. Op dat moment waren er geen verdere groeiplannen en werd de focus door Thijs en Teun gelegd op de twee vestigingen. Dit veranderde toen Sander van Brussel in 2012 aanklopte bij Thijs en Teun met de vraag of hij een eigen vestiging kon openen. Vanuit deze vraag werd in 2012 besloten een franchiseformule te schrijven. Vanaf dat moment ging het hard, en werden verschillende vestigingen door franchisenemers geopend. Op moment van schrijven telt Brownies&downieS 40 vestigingen. Brownies&downieS heeft de doelstelling om in 2020 87 vestigingen te hebben verdeeld over heel Nederland en België. Door onze interesse in het concept zijn Rutger Kanis en ik in maart 2016 in contact gekomen met Brownies&downieS.

"I have over 16 years experience in a vast number of areas within the Software Development industry. Over the past few years, I've shifted my focus to web technologies with a particular emphasis on front-end/client-side development, i.e. (X)HTML, CSS, and in particular have been shaping myself into somewhat of a Javascript guru. Having had a great deal of experience in the technical side of things such as coding with Delphi, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript (to name about 10% of the varied technlogies/languages I have experience with), as well as Business Analysis, Project and Product Management in the Retail, Supply Chain and Point of Sale sectors, there is one thing which truly triggers my interest nowadays: Pushing the boundaries of client-side Web Development and Javascript engineering. Without a robust, standards-compliant working knowledge of (X)HTML and CSS, much of Javascript's output would be invisible, but Javascript itself is very much underrated and misunderstood by a great number of developers. Understood and used properly, it is an elegant, robust, scalable and flexible language which has a lot of power. My aim with Javascript is to push things further, and ""spread-the-word"", so to speak, of the correct ways to develop in JS, and how to unleash its potential. Specialties: Retail, Financial Services, Media and Social Media industries, Agile Project Management/Lead (Scrum/Kanban/Lean), Agile process facilitation, Business Analysis, Offshoring/outsourcing consultancy and training, Multi-tier & service-oriented application architecture, design and development, Javascript, CSS3 & HTML5, Application & Web Application framework architecture and design, Talent acquisition, training and mentoring, C#, ASP.NET MVC, Dephi, Web 2.0 design and development (specialising in best practice javascript and AJAX development), Secure cross-domain communications  [{""company"":""Ask4Software Limited"",""company_id"":""ask4software-limited"",""location"":"""",""positions"":[{""description"":""Always willing to speak to potential clients for on-site front-end development and/or agile team-lead contracts, and businesses considering outsourcing projects and/or development talent to offshore teams.

"I am passionate about finding companies better packaging solutions to reduce their total cost and carbon footprint. So far on my journey, I have helped companies to reduce at least 10% of their total packaging supply chain costs. I grew up in a packaging-supplier family in China, where I learnt about all aspects of packaging. This knowledge enables me to identify / generate qualified suppliers in coastal cities in China, for example: Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Huizhou and Shanghai. I am an ambitious, enthusiastic and responsible person, who values integrity. I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person. Outside of work, I enjoy travel, meeting new people and hearing different perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about sustainability, supply chain management or packaging possibilities.

"I'm an actor, artist, musician and filmmaker based in San Diego, California, USA. When I was a little boy, I had a heart for entertainment. As an actor, I like to do character acting on-screen and voice-overs (that goes for narrations). As an artist, I like to draw, make art out of specific foods, and do digital art (Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator). As a musician, I'm a singer and pianist / keyboardist. As a filmmaker, I like to write, produce, direct, edit (w/ Adobe Premiere Pro and Reason), compose, and so much more, but there are specific roles in filmmaking that I'm primarily good at. I'm a jack-of-all-trades type of guy who likes to put of different hats, whether it's in film or media. For any (Family-Friendly recommended) projects, I'm your go-to person. Just give me a contact.

"I am passionate about science, searching, learning, coding, designing, business development, data, marketing, computer science, sci-fi, anime, board games, and intellectual talk. My hobbies are board games, coding, graphics & video design, project development, anime, and talking with friends. I am a fairly disciplined person with a sense of responsibility, open to new ideas and changing my mind, and I always respect scientific data when presented. I personally believe more in what the actual data tells me than a hunch, learned that the hard way :) I have personally worked in many departments over my professional career and have extensive experience in international trade (import&export), PR, CRM, design (graphic+structural), data analysis, sales & marketing as well as above-average experience in procurement, production, quality management, accounting, coding, business development, and project management.

"My biggest passion in life is Cybersecurity as I have been dreaming to become an Ethical Hacker since I was a kid. This is the main reason to study for my Telecommunication Engineering Degree where I improved my knowledge in this field. Moreover, I also enjoy Cryptography and Networks, the basis of Cybersecurity. I love to use my skills to help critical infrastructure (Finance, Telecommunications, Defense/Military, Aerospace, Pharmaceutical...) meet their high standards for Cybersecurity. My technical skills range from successfully conducting a Pentest to Network Traffic Analysis, Vulnerability Assessment, Threat Hunting and performing high-quality wired and wireless attacks, as well as offering Mitigation Strategies for these attacks (Blue Team) for Security Operations Center (SOC) roles. I also have deep knowledge of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Azure Cloud. Moreover, I am an experienced programmer in Python and JavaScript. On top of that, I have strong reporting skills and Soft Skills for client-based jobs, as well as Time and Project Management skills and Leadership. I see myself as a proactive, disciplined, constant individual who does not give up in the face of any problem. Next steps: Get CCNA, OSCP/CEH and learn more about SCADA and IoT Hacking in Industrial Networks (OT Security).

"Hi, prior to taking a year out to go to college and before that caring for my terminally ill husband, I was producing a range of video content for a Casino website and their social media. I have worked in both consumer and B2B sales and in marketing agencies as an account manager across a wide spectrum of industries, making me an adaptable, profitable member of a team with excellent client management experience. In my previous role as a BDM, I usually exceeded company targets on a regular basis whilst dealing with small owner managed businesses to international corporations. Therefore, I have both client side and agency experience. So, if you have an interesting proposition please contact me on 07712 647381. Thank you.

"I am a development practitioner who works as an agent of change in all capacities. A sustainable change is what I quest for in all endeavour and I do so by quickly learning and talking into the worldview of my hearers. I served as a social worker for two years in Volta north(krachi-Abujuro to be specific) under the Third Trimester Field Program of the University of Development Studies Ghana. I have also just worked as a missionary for two years in fostering a new church and it's community for the Seventh Day Adventist Church of Ghana in Bole-Mandare. I participated in developing and administering questionnaire to build effective structures for nursery operation in Cocobod-Ched Ghana in Berekum. Within a period of 10 months I work as an extensionist in 15 communities to change the feeling of indifference by farmers toward Ched Berekum through regular farm visit, intensified farm measurement, rigorous group formation and strengthening, timely farm inspection, phone call extension services, efficient and equitable distribution of chemical inputs and fertilizer to farmers and strengthening social tides with farmers. In the forest investment program (FIP) in Ghana I served as a cordinator in organizing rallies and training for cocoa farmers.

"Hello LinkedIners! Morten here, I am an outgoing, energetic and creative soul who has years of experience behind me in various industries. Regardless of the industry, I have always had my MOTTO top of mind: You get what you give! The motto has given me a lot of joy, at work as well as privately. If we all start our communication at zero, with the text: ""You're ok, I'm ok"", whether we are Directors or Laundry Helpers - we get synergies that are absolutely essential for joint happiness and success. For approx. a year ago I discovered AI - Digital art, and I have been hooked on this field ever since. Got good press coverage and now have a contract with an agent company in Paris, France.

"Highly flexible and adaptable British male voiceover artist and actor with nigh-on 20 years' experience behind the mic, voicing everything from TV and radio commericals to corporate videos and children's programmes.

It is not unusual to be asked to produce multiple voices in one session - giving me the chance to spread my vocal wings...and the client the chance to save some of their budget by not booking loads of different voice people!

"My software career began in 2016 when an academic advisor told me it is easier to teach coding to a physicist than it is to teach a programmer physics. That was then nurtured by my research advisor for the next 3 years. Of course, it’s never easy practicing coding between physics classes and research, but with the right guidance, it can certainly be done. Shoutout to Dr. Nutter and Dr. Zacate who never let me take the easy way; I have been the better for it ever since. Not only does my unique foundation bring creative solutions to the industry, but also a discipline to ensure higher quality results. The practice often gets me labeled as an overachiever; however, I find doing a little extra work up front makes for less work overall. For example, as a DBA, I made it a habit to keep tabs on troublesome servers. Since naming conventions are not consistent, it was tedious keeping up with which server had what issue. But knowing the history of a server allowed me to combine past solutions into permanent resolutions. Once my team saw the results, I became one of our company’s preferred representatives for disaster-level recovery events within 6 months. But my DBA days are over (for now). I’m currently working as a Controls Software Engineer. I have learned a lot in the last decade and I believe that this job allows me to pool all my previous knowledge into a building block for my next challenge. From designing the architecture of new features to being hands on with machine diagnostics, there are many aspects of the process I must be familiar with. But I like a good puzzle, and balancing the demands of custom orders always brings something interesting through the door. Looking back, I am proud to say that I never backed down from a challenge. I am a self-motivated and self-made code monkey. I look forward with excitement for what I will accomplish next.

"Trusted real estate agent in the Norcross, Duluth, Alpharetta, Cumming, Suwanee and the John's Creek area! I've had the privileged of working with amazing clients in real estate for 5+ years. Going with Keller Williams and the Chattahoochee North office in Peachtree Corners was the best decision I have ever made. I just finished off my best year yet with 6 Million in closed volume. I have been on the agent leadership council (ALC) at my office as well as being a mentor and productivity coach. I have my SRS (seller's representative specialist) and ABR (accredited Buyer's Representative) designations. Through these 5 years I have worked with an assortment of buyers and sellers and there is no age and stage that I won't serve well. My clients value my diligence, hard work, negotiating skills and knowledge. Before getting into real estate I worked in Gwinnett County Schools as a high school Chemistry teacher for 11 years. I was successful for 11 years with selling my students on my classroom setup, ideas on learning and their need to have a solid education. I educated students on how to learn and how to believe in themselves. The greatest compliment ever was said by a former student: ""Mr McCoy you made me believe that I was good at science"". That student went on to the University of North Carolina and is now a medical doctor.

I begin with a tour of the RTLS applications and then serve you the details of what goes into an RTLS and what the various RTLS technologies are. Then, I plunge into the practical things that you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks and attacks. After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make an RTLS work for you. Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS makes some topics more relevant than others.

"My personal and professional journey has endured many twists and turns to this point. It has presented significant challenges, satisfying successes, frustrating failures, incredible learning, great friendships and above all else it has provided fulfilment and enjoyment.Along my personal journey I have acquired over twenty five years of professional learning and experience in leadership, management, business development, change management, cultural change, people development and a strong systems perspective. This has left me fully equipped for making solid and meaningful impact when improving business performance.I would describe myself as a highly experienced leader and coach responsible for enabling individuals and organisations with the knowledge and confidence to realise real transformational change. My experience has taught me this is best achieved by focusing on the principles and purpose behind what we do, the why, and not just how we do it. The result is an environment where people feel emotionally safe and able to challenge the status quo, where they can leverage their abilities to solve problems and think creatively about their daily work.My approach is influenced by both my practical experiences and many thought leaders whose thinking is reflected in The Shingo Model for Enterprise Excellence. I have worked in depth with the Enterprise Excellence and the Shingo Model after leading the team that successfully launched The Shingo Prize in the UK and Europe in 2008. As a result I have been able to guide many organisations by helping them implement the changes that are conveyed by a principle based approach to excellence, which has included many Shingo recognition and Prize winning sites.

"Helping people: that's the whole reason we went into medicine, right? We see suffering and put our best efforts into relieving it. We recognize not everyone will understand, appreciate, or follow our instructions, but we don't stop giving. We are generous with our time, open with our experiences, and honest in our assessments - especially our assessment of ourselves. We are never too busy to listen, too tired to care, or too proud to laugh at ourselves. Most of us will never change the world; but we will get to witness the world change for countless individuals because of medicine.
