# Personality Analyzer from LinkedIn and GitHub


## ðŸ“‘ Abstract

This web-based application utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze personality traits from professional profiles such as LinkedIn and GitHub. The system predicts the Big Five personality traitsâ€”**Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism**â€”using fine-tuned BERT models. Developed in **Streamlit**, it offers interactive visualizations, batch analysis, and PDF report generationâ€”ideal for HR, psychologists, and data enthusiasts.

## 1. Introduction

Professional behavior analysis is valuable for recruitment, self-evaluation, and personality insights. This project leverages AI to extract text from LinkedIn/GitHub and predict personality traits using BERT-based models.


## 2. Problem Statement

Although vast professional data is available online, no easily accessible tool translates it into psychological insights. There's a need to interpret this data into personality assessment.


## 3. Proposed Solution

A web app processes LinkedIn/GitHub content, extracts embeddings, and uses AI models to predict traits, presenting results visually and via downloadable PDFs.
